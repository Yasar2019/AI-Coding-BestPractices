# Common Mistakes in Prompt Engineering

1. **Ambiguity**
   - **Mistake:** Writing vague prompts like "Tell me about AI."
   - **Solution:** Be specific. Example: "Explain the benefits of AI in healthcare in under 100 words."

2. **Overloading the Prompt**
   - **Mistake:** Asking for multiple unrelated tasks in one prompt.
   - **Solution:** Break down tasks into separate prompts.

3. **Ignoring Iterative Refinement**
   - **Mistake:** Assuming the first response is the best.
   - **Solution:** Refine your prompt based on initial outputs.
